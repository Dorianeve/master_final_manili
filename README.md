# ACAPS Access Methodology - Evaluation utilizing Bayesian Networks

Work of Claudia Manili - Data Analyst and Humanitarian Access Focal Point for ACAPS | Student of Master in Data Science for Economics, Business and Finance

## Abstract

The aim of this study is to explore the analysis framework used by ACAPS, a project of the international NGO Norwegian Refugee Council, to assess and measure the humanitarian access constraints in operational settings. It does so by the exploration of the different components of the analysis framework, trying to explore and establish connections between the utilized indicators. Bayesian networks is chosen as the probabilistic graphical models to explore the conditional dependencies between the set of used variables. This analysis will serve two purposes: a deep review of the current methodology, which can constitute the basis for adjustments or further improvement, and the final work of the Master in Data Science for Economics, Business and Finance 2020-2021.
